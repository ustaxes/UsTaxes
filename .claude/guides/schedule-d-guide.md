- **S:** Gain/loss not reported on 1099-B

## Cost Basis Calculation

### Default Method: FIFO (First In, First Out)

Unless you specify otherwise, IRS assumes FIFO.

**Example:**
- Jan 2023: Buy 100 shares @ $50 = $5,000
- Jun 2023: Buy 100 shares @ $60 = $6,000
- Dec 2024: Sell 100 shares @ $70 = $7,000

**FIFO:** Sell the January shares
- Basis: $5,000
- Proceeds: $7,000
- Gain: $2,000 (long-term)

### Specific Identification

You can choose which shares to sell.

**Requirements:**
- Specify shares AT TIME OF SALE
- Broker must confirm in writing
- Keep confirmation records

**Example (same facts):**
- Specify selling June shares
- Basis: $6,000
- Proceeds: $7,000
- Gain: $1,000 (long-term)

**Tax savings:** Lower gain = lower tax

### Average Cost Method

Only for mutual funds (not individual stocks).

**Calculation:**
- Total cost of all shares / Total shares
- Weighted average

**Example:**
- Jan: Buy 100 shares @ $50 = $5,000
- Jun: Buy 100 shares @ $60 = $6,000
- Total: 200 shares, $11,000
- Average cost: $11,000 / 200 = $55/share

**Sell 100 shares @ $70:**
- Basis: 100 × $55 = $5,500
- Proceeds: $7,000
- Gain: $1,500

### Inherited Property

**Step-up in basis:**
Basis = Fair market value on date of death (or 6 months later if estate elects).

**Holding period:**
Automatically long-term, regardless of how long you held it.

**Example:**
- Decedent bought stock in 1980 for $10,000
- FMV at death (2023): $100,000
- Your basis: $100,000 (step-up)
- Sell in 2024 for $105,000
- Gain: $5,000 (long-term)

### Gifted Property

**Basis:**
- Generally donor's basis (carryover basis)
- If FMV at gift < donor's basis, special rules apply

**Holding period:**
- Includes donor's holding period (tack on)

**Example:**
- Donor bought in 2020 for $50,000
- Gifted to you in 2023 (FMV: $60,000)
- Your basis: $50,000
- Your holding period: Starts in 2020
- Sell in 2024 for $70,000
- Gain: $20,000 (long-term, held >1 year from 2020)

## Wash Sale Rule

**Rule:** Cannot deduct loss if you buy "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.

**30-Day Window:**
- 30 days before sale
- Day of sale
- 30 days after sale
- Total: 61-day period

**Substantially Identical:**
- Same stock
- Options on same stock
- Substantially identical securities (similar but not same company usually OK)

**Effect:**
- Loss is disallowed
- Disallowed loss added to basis of replacement shares
- Holding period includes period of original shares

**Example:**
- Jan 1: Buy 100 shares XYZ @ $100 = $10,000
- Jun 1: Sell 100 shares @ $80 = $8,000 (loss: $2,000)
- Jun 15: Buy 100 shares @ $82 = $8,200

**Wash Sale:**
- $2,000 loss disallowed (bought within 30 days)
- New basis: $8,200 + $2,000 = $10,200
- Holding period: Starts Jan 1 (original purchase)

**When loss is realized:**
- When you sell the replacement shares (outside wash sale window)
- Loss is built into higher basis

**How to Avoid:**
- Wait 31+ days to repurchase
- Buy similar (not identical) security
- Buy in different account (IRA, spouse's account - still triggers wash sale)

**IRS Reporting:**
- Broker reports wash sales on 1099-B (Code W)
- Report on Form 8949 with adjustment code W

## Capital Loss Limitations

**Maximum Deduction:**
- $3,000 per year ($1,500 if MFS)
- Deductible against ordinary income (wages, interest, etc.)

**Excess Losses:**
- Carry forward indefinitely
- Deduct $3,000 per year until exhausted
- Character preserved (short-term vs. long-term)

**Netting Rules:**
1. Net short-term gains and losses
2. Net long-term gains and losses
3. Net the two results

**Example 1: Short-term loss, long-term gain**
- Short-term loss: -$10,000
- Long-term gain: +$5,000
- Net: -$5,000
- Deduct $3,000 this year
- Carry forward $2,000 short-term loss

**Example 2: Large capital loss**
- Total capital loss: -$50,000
- Deduct $3,000 per year
- Takes 17 years to fully deduct (if no other gains)

**Strategy:**
- Harvest capital gains to use up losses
- $50,000 loss + $50,000 gain = $0 tax
- Don't let losses expire unused

## Special Situations

### Cryptocurrency

Treated as property, not currency.

**Taxable Events:**
- Sell crypto for cash

- Holding period determines short/long-term

**Reporting:**
- Form 8949 and Schedule D
- Each transaction reported separately
- Use crypto tax software (CoinTracker, CoinLedger, etc.)

- No gain recognized (deferred)
- New basis: $300,000 (carryover)

**Reporting:**
- Form 8824 (Like-Kind Exchanges)

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Tax-Loss Harvesting

Sell losing investments to offset gains.

**Strategy:**
- Identify losing positions
- Sell to realize losses
- Use losses to offset gains (unlimited)
- Use excess losses to offset $3,000 ordinary income
- Carry forward remaining losses

**Timing:**
- Harvest losses in December (before year-end)
- Offset gains realized during year

**Watch Out:**
- Wash sale rule (wait 31 days to repurchase)
- Buy similar (not identical) securities to maintain exposure

### 2. Capital Gain Harvesting

Realize gains in 0% tax bracket years.

**Strategy:**
- If taxable income <$94,050 (MFJ), 0% long-term capital gains rate
- Sell appreciated assets
- Pay $0 tax
- Re-buy immediately (no wash sale rule for gains)
- Step up basis

**Example:**
- MFJ with $80,000 taxable income
- Can realize $14,050 in long-term gains at 0% rate
- Sell $14,000 in gains, re-buy same day
- New basis stepped up by $14,000

### 3. Holding Period Management

Hold >1 year for long-term rates.

**Strategy:**
- Track purchase dates carefully
- Wait 1 day past 1-year anniversary
- Save 10-25% in taxes (ordinary vs. long-term rates)

**Example:**
- $100,000 gain
- Short-term (37% bracket): $37,000 tax
- Long-term (20% bracket): $20,000 tax
- Savings: $17,000 by waiting 1 extra day

### 4. Gifting Appreciated Assets

Give appreciated assets to children or charity.

**To Children:**
- If child in 0% or 10% bracket, they pay low/no tax
- Give assets with unrealized gains
- They sell and pay little tax

**To Charity:**
- Donate appreciated assets (stock, crypto, real estate)
- Deduct FMV on Schedule A
- Avoid capital gains tax
- Better than selling and donating cash

**Example:**
- Stock worth $10,000 (basis: $2,000)
- Donate to charity
- Deduct $10,000 on Schedule A
- Avoid $8,000 gain (save $1,200-$1,600 in tax)

### 5. Asset Location

Hold tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

**Taxable Accounts:**
- Stocks (long-term growth, qualified dividends)
- Tax-efficient funds (index funds)
- Municipal bonds (tax-free interest)

**Tax-Deferred Accounts (IRA, 401k):**
- Bonds (ordinary income)
- REITs (ordinary income)
- High-turnover funds

**Benefit:**
- Minimize taxes on taxable account holdings
- Defer taxes on high-income holdings in retirement accounts

### 6. Timing of Sales

Control which year you recognize gains.

**Strategy:**
- Large income year: Delay sales (or harvest losses)
- Low income year: Realize gains (or sell losers in future years)
- Manage gains/losses across tax years

### 7. Estimated Tax Planning

Pay estimated taxes to avoid penalties.

**Quarterly Payments:**
- April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15
- Pay 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year
- Higher earners (>$150,000): 110% of prior year

**Capital Gains:**
- If large gain in Q4, make estimated payment by January 15
- Avoid underpayment penalty

## Record Keeping

**Required Documentation:**

**For Each Sale:**
- Purchase confirmation (date, price, shares)
- Sale confirmation (date, price, shares)
- 1099-B from broker
- Dividend reinvestment records
- Cost basis adjustments (splits, mergers, return of capital)

**Cryptocurrency:**
- Transaction history from all exchanges
- Wallet addresses
- Dates and amounts of all trades
- Cost basis for each acquisition

**Real Estate:**
- Purchase closing statement
- Sale closing statement
- Improvement records
- Depreciation schedules
- Form 1099-S (sale of real estate)

**How Long to Keep:**
- Tax returns: Permanently
- Supporting documents: 7 years
- Cost basis records: Until sale + 7 years

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Reporting All Transactions
- IRS receives 1099-B from broker
- Failure to report = IRS notice
- Report ALL transactions, even if not on 1099-B

### 2. Incorrect Basis
- Forgetting dividend reinvestments (increases basis)
- Not tracking stock splits (adjusts basis)
- Not including commissions in basis

### 3. Wash Sales
- Repurchasing within 30 days
- Buying in spouse's account (still wash sale)
- Buying in IRA (still wash sale)

### 4. Short-Term vs. Long-Term
- Holding exactly 1 year (short-term, not long-term)
- Not tracking purchase dates

### 5. Forgetting Carryover Losses
- Must track manually year-to-year
- Attach statement if large carryover

### 6. Cryptocurrency Errors
- Not reporting trades (only cash sales)
- Forgetting about small transactions
- Using wrong cost basis method
