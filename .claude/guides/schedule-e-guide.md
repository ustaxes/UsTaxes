### Depreciation Details

**Residential Rental Property:**
- **Recovery period:** 27.5 years
- **Method:** Straight-line
- **Convention:** Mid-month (property placed in service mid-month)

**How to calculate:**
1. Determine basis (purchase price + closing costs)
2. Subtract land value (not depreciable)
3. Divide building value by 27.5 years
4. Adjust for first and last year (mid-month convention)

**Example:**
- Purchase price: $300,000
- Land value: $50,000
- Building value: $250,000
- Annual depreciation: $250,000 / 27.5 = $9,091
- First year (purchased June): 7/12 months = $5,303

**Improvements:**
Depreciate separately over 27.5 years starting when placed in service:
- New roof: $15,000 → $545/year
- New HVAC: $8,000 → $291/year
- Kitchen remodel: $20,000 → $727/year

**Bonus Depreciation:**
Not available for residential rental property (only for business property with recovery period of 20 years or less).

**Section 179:**
Not available for residential rental property.

### Income/Loss Calculation

**Line 20:** Total expenses
- Sum of lines 5-19

**Line 21:** Subtract line 20 from line 3 (4 for royalties)
- This is your **net rental income or loss** per property

**Line 22:** Deductible rental real estate loss
- See Line 43 instructions (passive loss limitations)

**Line 23a:** Total income (add all properties with positive line 21)

**Line 23b:** Total losses (add all properties with negative line 21)

**Line 24:** Total rental real estate and royalty income (or loss)
- Combine 23a and 23b
- Goes to Schedule 1, Line 5

### Passive Loss Limitations

**General Rule:**
Rental activities are **passive** by default. Passive losses can only offset passive income.

**Exception - $25,000 Special Allowance:**
If you **actively participate**, you can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against non-passive income.

**Active Participation Requirements:**
- Own at least 10% of property
- Make management decisions:
  - Approve tenants
  - Approve repairs
  - Set rental terms
- Can use property manager, but YOU make decisions

**Phase-Out:**
Special allowance phases out $1 for every $2 of MAGI over:
- $100,000 (single, MFJ, QW)
- $50,000 (MFS)
- Fully phased out at $150,000

**Real Estate Professionals:**
If you qualify as a **real estate professional**, rental activities are NOT passive.

**Requirements:**
- More than 50% of personal services in real property trades
- More than 750 hours per year in real property trades
- Material participation in each rental activity

**Material Participation Tests:**
1. 500+ hours
2. Substantially all participation
3. 100+ hours AND no one else has more
4. Significant participation activity (100+ hours, total 500+)
5. Material participation in 5 of last 10 years
6. Personal service activity with material participation in 3 prior years
7. Facts and circumstances (100+ hours, regular, continuous)

### Rental Property Types

**Traditional Long-Term Rental:**
- Lease 12+ months
- Tenant pays utilities
- Standard depreciation (27.5 years)
- Passive activity

**Vacation/Short-Term Rental:**
If average rental period ≤7 days OR ≤30 days with significant services:
- May NOT be passive
- Different rules apply
- Report on Schedule C if substantial services provided

**Personal Use Rules:**
If you use the rental property personally, special rules apply.

**Personal Use Days:**
- Days you use it
- Days family uses it (unless paying fair rent)
- Days rented below fair market value
- Days used for repairs don't count (if primary purpose is repairs)

**Vacation Home Rules:**
If personal use >14 days OR >10% of rental days:
- Expenses must be allocated between personal and rental use
- Rental deductions limited to rental income
- Cannot create or increase loss

**Calculation:**
- Rental use percentage = Rental days / (Rental days + Personal days)
- Multiply expenses by rental use percentage
- Exception: Mortgage interest and taxes fully deductible (allocate between Sch E and Sch A)

**Example:**
- Rented 90 days at $200/day = $18,000 income
- Personal use 30 days
- Total days: 120
- Rental percentage: 90/120 = 75%
- Expenses: $15,000 × 75% = $11,250 deductible on Schedule E
- Remaining 25% ($3,750) is personal (not deductible, except mortgage interest/taxes on Schedule A)

## Part II: Partnerships and S Corporations

Report income from Schedule K-1 (Form 1065 or 1120-S).

**Line 28:** Name, address, EIN of partnership/S corporation

**Column (a):** Check if partnership (P) or S corporation (S)

**Column (b):** Check if you're general (G) or limited (L) partner

**Column (c):** Check if at-risk limitations apply

**Column (d):** Check if you materially participated

**Column (e-h):** Passive income, nonpassive income, Section 179, total

**Common K-1 Line Items:**
- **Line 1:** Ordinary business income/loss → Schedule E
- **Line 2-3:** Net rental income/loss → Schedule E
- **Line 4-6:** Guaranteed payments, interest, dividends
- **Line 7-10:** Royalties, capital gains, other income
- **Line 11-13:** Section 179, charitable contributions, deductions

**Passive vs. Nonpassive:**
- **Passive:** Limited partner, no material participation
- **Nonpassive:** General partner with material participation

## Part III: Estates and Trusts

Report income from Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).

Similar to Part II, but for estates and trusts.

**Lines 32-37:** Similar structure to Part II

## Part IV: REMICs

Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (rare).

Report from Schedule Q (Form 1066).

## Part V: Summary

**Line 42:** Reconciliation for QBI deduction (Form 8995/8995-A)

**Line 43:** Deductible rental real estate loss (after passive loss limitations)

**Line 44:** Total rental real estate and royalty income or loss

## Depreciation Recapture

When you sell rental property, depreciation is "recaptured" and taxed.

**Section 1250 Recapture:**
- Applies to real property (buildings)
- Depreciation taxed at 25% (unrecaptured Section 1250 gain)
- On Form 4797 and Schedule D

**Example:**
- Purchased: $300,000 (building: $250,000)
- Depreciation claimed: $50,000
- Adjusted basis: $250,000
- Sold for: $350,000
- Gain: $100,000
  - $50,000 depreciation recapture (25% tax)
  - $50,000 capital gain (0%, 15%, or 20% tax)

## Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction

Rental real estate can qualify for 20% QBI deduction if it's a **trade or business**.

**Safe Harbor (IRS Notice 2019-7):**
Rental real estate is a trade or business if:
- Separate books and records maintained
- 250+ hours of rental services per year:
  - Advertising
  - Negotiating leases
  - Tenant screening
  - Rent collection
  - Maintenance/repairs
  - Property management
  - Property supervision
- Maintain time logs
- Applies to each enterprise (can group similar properties)

**Triple Net Lease:**
Does NOT qualify (tenant pays all expenses, landlord does minimal work).

**QBI Deduction Calculation:**
- Generally 20% of qualified business income
- Limitations apply based on taxable income
- W-2 wages and property basis limitations at higher incomes
- See Form 8995 or 8995-A

## Record Keeping

- Property records: 7 years after sale
- Depreciation schedules: Permanently (or until property sold + 7 years)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Repairs and Improvements
- **Repair:** Deduct immediately
- **Improvement:** Depreciate over 27.5 years
- When in doubt, depreciate

### 2. Forgetting to Depreciate
- Required, not optional
- Must depreciate even if property doesn't generate income
- Can't deduct missed depreciation later (must amend)

### 3. Deducting Personal Use
- Only rental portion is deductible
- Must allocate expenses if mixed use
- Keep detailed records

### 4. Passive Loss Limitations
- Can't deduct losses without active participation
- $25,000 limit phases out at higher incomes
- Suspended losses carry forward

### 5. Not Tracking Improvements
- Need basis records for depreciation recapture
- Keep all improvement invoices permanently
- Track cost segregation if large improvements

### 6. Security Deposits
- NOT income when received
- Only income if kept
- Must keep separate account (in many states)

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Maximize Deductible Expenses
- Track ALL expenses, no matter how small
- Use separate credit card for rental expenses
- Keep detailed records
- Don't miss mileage deductions

### 2. Cost Segregation
- Accelerate depreciation on components
- Separate building into components with shorter lives:
  - Carpets: 5 years
  - Appliances: 5 years
  - Landscaping: 15 years
  - Building: 27.5 years
- Requires professional cost segregation study
- Worth it for properties >$500,000

### 3. Timing of Repairs vs. Improvements
- If planning major work, consider timing:
  - Multiple small repairs (deductible) vs.
  - One large improvement (depreciate)
- Bunch repairs in high-income years for bigger deduction

### 4. Real Estate Professional Status
- If you qualify, losses fully deductible
- No passive loss limitations
- Requires 750+ hours and >50% of work time
- Keep detailed time logs

### 5. Rent to Family
- Can rent to family members
- Must charge fair market rent
- Family member can't use as vacation home
- Treats it as regular rental

### 6. Material Participation
- 100 hours may qualify under certain tests
- Track hours carefully
- Especially important for high earners ($150,000+)

### 7. QBI Deduction
- Maintain 250+ hours of rental services
- Keep detailed time logs
- Can group similar properties
- 20% deduction can be substantial

## Rental Property Scenarios

### Example 1: Single-Family Rental (Profit)

**Property:** 1234 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345
**Type:** Single family residence
**Days rented:** 365
**Days personal:** 0

**Income:**
- Rents received: $24,000 (12 × $2,000)

**Expenses:**
- Mortgage interest: $8,000
- Property taxes: $3,600
- Insurance: $1,200
- Repairs: $1,500
- Utilities: $0 (tenant pays)
- Property management: $2,400 (10%)
- Depreciation: $7,273 (building value $200,000 / 27.5)
- HOA fees: $1,200
- Total expenses: $25,173

**Result:**
- Net rental loss: -$1,173
- If active participation and MAGI <$100,000: Full loss deductible
- If MAGI >$150,000: Loss suspended (carry forward)

### Example 2: Vacation Rental (Mixed Use)

**Property:** Beach condo
**Days rented:** 60 days @ $250/day
**Days personal:** 20 days

**Income:**
- Rents received: $15,000

**Expenses (total):**
- Mortgage interest: $9,000
- Property taxes: $4,000
- Insurance: $1,800
- Utilities: $2,400
- Repairs: $1,200
- Cleaning: $1,500
- Depreciation: $5,000
- Total: $24,900

**Calculation:**
- Rental percentage: 60 / (60 + 20) = 75%
- Deductible expenses: $24,900 × 75% = $18,675
- BUT limited to rental income: $15,000
- Net rental income: $0
- Excess expenses ($3,675) NOT deductible, NOT carried forward
- Exception: Mortgage interest and taxes allocable to personal use can go on Schedule A

**Personal portion:**
- Mortgage interest: $9,000 × 25% = $2,250 (Schedule A)
- Property taxes: $4,000 × 25% = $1,000 (Schedule A)

### Example 3: Multi-Unit Property (Cash Flow Positive)

**Property:** 4-unit apartment building
**All units rented full year**

**Income:**
- Unit 1: $1,200 × 12 = $14,400
- Unit 2: $1,200 × 12 = $14,400
- Unit 3: $1,100 × 12 = $13,200
- Unit 4: $1,100 × 12 = $13,200
- Total rents: $55,200

**Expenses:**
- Mortgage interest: $18,000
- Property taxes: $8,000
- Insurance: $3,600
- Utilities (landlord pays): $4,800
- Repairs: $4,500
- Property management: $5,520 (10%)
- Landscaping: $1,200
- Snow removal: $800
- Depreciation: $10,909 (building: $300,000 / 27.5)
- Other (supplies, etc.): $1,500
- Total expenses: $58,829

**Result:**
- Net rental loss: -$3,629
- If active participation and MAGI <$100,000: Full deduction
- If MAGI >$150,000: Loss suspended

**QBI Consideration:**
If landlord maintains 250+ hours (tenant screening, rent collection, repairs, etc.):
- May qualify for QBI deduction
- Must maintain time logs
- 20% deduction on net income (if profitable)

## State Considerations

Most states follow federal Schedule E, but some have additional rules:

**California:**
- Different passive loss limits
- Additional forms may be required

**New York:**
- NYC may require UBT (Unincorporated Business Tax) for rentals
- Additional city tax forms

**Check your state's requirements:**
- State-specific rental income forms
- Different depreciation rules
- Credits for energy-efficient improvements

## IRS Scrutiny Areas

**Audit Red Flags:**
- Consistent losses year after year (hobby loss rules)
- High expenses relative to income
- 100% business use of vehicle
- Excessive travel expenses
- No documentation
- Mixing personal and rental use without proper allocation

**Documentation is Critical:**
- Keep ALL receipts
- Maintain mileage logs
- Take photos of repairs/damage
- Keep copies of leases
- Bank statements showing rental income/expenses
