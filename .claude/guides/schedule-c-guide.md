Deduct up to 20% of qualified business income.

**Eligibility:**

- Not C-corp or employee wages

**Limitations:**

- Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) restrictions

**SSTB includes:**

- Financial services
- Brokerage services
- Limited if income over threshold

## Audit Red Flags

IRS scrutinizes:
- **100% business vehicle use** - Unlikely and often audited
- **Large home office deduction** - Must be legitimate
- **High expenses relative to income** - Should be profitable
- **Round numbers** - Use exact amounts
- **Cash-intensive business** - Extra scrutiny
- **Consistent losses** - Hobby loss rules apply

## Hobby vs. Business

**Hobby Loss Rules:**
If not engaged for profit, limited deductions.

**Factors IRS considers:**
- Manner you carry on activity
- Your expertise
- Time and effort expended
- Expectation of appreciation
- Success in similar activities
- History of income or losses
- Amount of occasional profits
- Your financial status
- Personal pleasure or recreation

**Safe harbor:**
Profit in 3 of last 5 years = presumed business

## State Tax Considerations

Most states:
- Follow federal Schedule C
- May have additional forms
- Different rules for home office
- Check state-specific requirements

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Maximize Deductions
- Track ALL expenses
- Don't miss small items
- Document everything

### 2. Retirement Contributions
- SEP-IRA: Up to 25% of net earnings, max $69,000
- Solo 401(k): Up to $69,000 ($76,500 if 50+)
- Both reduce taxable income

### 3. Equipment Purchases
- Section 179: Immediate expensing (up to $1,220,000)
- Bonus depreciation: Additional first-year deduction
- Plan purchases for maximum benefit

### 4. Estimated Tax Payments
- Pay quarterly to avoid penalties
- Use safe harbor (100-110% of prior year)
- Calculate based on expected income

### 5. Separate Entity Consideration
- LLC for liability protection (no tax change)
- S-Corp if net income >$60,000 (potential tax savings)
- Consult tax professional for analysis
