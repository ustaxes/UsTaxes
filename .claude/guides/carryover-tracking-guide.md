# Multi-Year Carryover Tracking Guide

Comprehensive guide for tracking tax attributes that carry forward across multiple tax years.

## Overview

Many tax items can carry forward to future years if they cannot be used in the current year. Proper tracking is essential to maximize tax savings and ensure compliance.

## Critical Importance

**Why Carryovers Matter:**
- Can save thousands of dollars in future years
- Required by IRS to track
- Failing to track = losing tax benefits
- Some carryovers expire (use it or lose it)
- Some carryovers are indefinite

**Common Mistake:**
Taxpayers often forget about carryovers and lose valuable tax benefits. This guide ensures ALL carryovers are tracked and used.

## Types of Carryovers

### 1. Capital Loss Carryover (Schedule D)

**Rule:**
- Maximum $3,000 deduction per year ($1,500 if MFS)
- Excess losses carry forward indefinitely
- Character preserved (short-term vs. long-term)

**Netting Order:**
1. Net all short-term gains and losses
2. Net all long-term gains and losses
3. Net the two results

**Carryover Character:**
- If short-term loss > long-term gain → short-term carryover
- If long-term loss > short-term gain → long-term carryover
- If both → both types carried forward

**Example 1: Simple Carryover**
- 2023: Capital loss of $15,000
- Deduct $3,000 in 2023
- Carryover to 2024: $12,000
- Deduct $3,000 in 2024
- Carryover to 2025: $9,000
- Continue until exhausted

**Example 2: Complex Carryover with Gains**
- 2023: $20,000 long-term loss
- Deduct $3,000 in 2023
- Carryover to 2024: $17,000 (long-term)
- 2024: $10,000 short-term gain
- Net: $17,000 LT loss - $10,000 ST gain = $7,000 net loss
- Deduct $3,000 in 2024
- Carryover to 2025: $4,000 (long-term)

**Tracking Required:**
- Total carryover amount
- Short-term portion
- Long-term portion
- Year of origin

**Form:**
- Schedule D, Line 6 (short-term) and Line 14 (long-term)

**Expiration:** Never (indefinite)

### 2. Passive Activity Loss Carryover (Form 8582)

**Rule:**
- Passive losses can only offset passive income
- Excess losses carry forward indefinitely
- Released when activity disposed of

**What are Passive Activities:**
- Rental real estate (unless real estate professional)
- Limited partnerships
- Businesses you don't materially participate in

**Special $25,000 Allowance:**
- Can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against non-passive income
- Requires active participation
- Phases out: $100,000 - $150,000 MAGI (single, MFJ)

**Example:**
- 2023: Rental property loss of $30,000
- MAGI: $120,000 (MFJ)
- Phase-out: ($120,000 - $100,000) × 50% = $10,000
- Allowable loss: $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000
- Deductible in 2023: $15,000
- Carryover to 2024: $15,000

**When Released:**
- Dispose of entire interest in passive activity
- Taxable disposition triggers release of all suspended losses
- Non-taxable disposition (gift, death) → losses lost

**Tracking Required:**
- Suspended loss by activity
- Year of origin
- Type of activity
- Active vs. passive participation

**Form:**
- Form 8582 (Passive Activity Loss Limitations)

**Expiration:** Released on disposition or indefinite

### 3. Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryforward

**Rule:**
- Business loss exceeds all income
- Carry forward indefinitely (for tax years 2018+)
- Deduction limited to 80% of taxable income (for tax years 2021+)

**What Creates NOL:**
- Schedule C loss (self-employment)
- Schedule F loss (farming)
- Rental real estate loss (if real estate professional)
- Employee business expenses (pre-TCJA)

**Calculation:**
- Start with negative taxable income
- Add back certain deductions (standard deduction, capital losses, etc.)
- Result = NOL

**Example:**
- 2023: Schedule C loss: $100,000
- Other income: $30,000
- NOL: $70,000
- 2024: Taxable income before NOL: $100,000
- NOL deduction: $100,000 × 80% = $80,000 (limited)
- But NOL is only $70,000, so deduct $70,000
- Remaining NOL: $0

**Tracking Required:**
- NOL amount
- Year of origin
- Amount used each year
- Remaining balance

**Form:**
- Form 1045 (Application for Tentative Refund) - optional
- Schedule 1, Line 8z (Other adjustments)

**Expiration:** Indefinite (post-2017 NOLs)

### 4. Charitable Contribution Carryover

**Rule:**
- Excess charitable contributions carry forward 5 years
- Must itemize in future years to use
- Subject to AGI limitations each year

**AGI Limitations:**
- Cash contributions: 60% of AGI
- Appreciated property (long-term): 30% of AGI
- Appreciated property to private foundation: 20% of AGI

**Example:**
- 2023: AGI $100,000, charitable contributions $80,000
- Limit: $100,000 × 60% = $60,000
- Deductible in 2023: $60,000
- Carryover to 2024-2028: $20,000

**Order of Deduction:**
- Current year contributions first
- Oldest carryovers next (FIFO)

**Tracking Required:**
- Carryover amount
- Type (cash vs. property)
- Year of origin
- Remaining years (expires after 5 years)

**Form:**
- Schedule A, Line 12 (gifts to charity)

**Expiration:** 5 years

### 5. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Credit

**Rule:**
- If you paid AMT in prior years due to timing differences (not exclusion items), you may have an AMT credit
- Credit can reduce regular tax (but not below tentative minimum tax)
- Carried forward indefinitely

**What Creates AMT Credit:**
- Exercising incentive stock options (ISOs)
- Depreciation differences
- Other timing differences

**What Doesn't Create AMT Credit:**
- Exclusion preferences (state tax deduction, etc.)

**Example:**
- 2023: Paid AMT of $10,000 (due to ISOs)
- Regular tax: $45,000
- Paid: $45,000 (higher of regular or AMT)
- AMT credit: $10,000 (carry forward)
- 2024: Regular tax $60,000, AMT $50,000
- Credit reduces regular tax: $60,000 - $10,000 = $50,000
- Credit used: $10,000

**Tracking Required:**
- Total AMT credit

- Track character and ordering rules

**Step 3: Update Balances**
- Subtract used amounts
- Calculate new balance
- Remove fully used carryovers

**Step 4: Add New Carryovers**
- Identify new carryovers created this year
- Add to tracking system
- Set expiration dates

**Step 5: Expiration Check**
- Identify expiring carryovers
- Warn user of upcoming expirations
- Remove expired carryovers

**Step 6: Export for Next Year**
- Save updated carryover file
- Generate summary report
- Archive for records

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Large Capital Loss from Stock Crash

**Situation:**
- 2024: Sold stocks, realized $100,000 long-term loss
- No other capital gains

**Year 1 (2024):**
- Deduct $3,000
- Carryover: $97,000

**Year 2 (2025):**
- Assume $20,000 capital gain
- Net: $97,000 loss - $20,000 gain = $77,000 loss
- Deduct $3,000
- Carryover: $74,000

**Year 3 (2026):**
- Assume $50,000 capital gain
- Net: $74,000 loss - $50,000 gain = $24,000 loss
- Deduct $3,000
- Carryover: $21,000

**Continue for 7 more years** to fully utilize (if no more gains)

**Tax Savings:**
- $100,000 loss × 22% (assuming 22% bracket) = $22,000 total savings
- Spread over 10+ years

### Scenario 2: Rental Property Suspended Losses

**Situation:**
- 2020-2024: Rental property losses $15,000/year
- MAGI >$150,000 (no special allowance)
- Total suspended: $75,000

**2025: Sell Property**
- Sale price: $400,000
- Basis: $300,000
- Gain: $100,000
- Release suspended losses: $75,000
- Net gain: $25,000

**Tax Impact:**
- Without suspended losses: $100,000 × 15% = $15,000 tax
- With suspended losses: $25,000 × 15% = $3,750 tax
- Savings: $11,250

### Scenario 3: Charitable Contribution Bunching

**Situation:**
- Typically give $10,000/year to charity
- AGI: $100,000
- Standard deduction: $29,200 (MFJ)

**Strategy: Bunch Contributions**

**Year 1 (2024):**
- Contribute 5 years' worth: $50,000
- Itemize: $50,000 (charity) + $15,000 (SALT/mortgage) = $65,000
- Tax savings: ($65,000 - $29,200) × 22% = $7,876

**Years 2-5 (2025-2028):**
- Take standard deduction: $29,200
- No additional charitable gifts

**vs. Annual Giving:**
- Annual itemized deduction: $25,000 (charity + SALT/mortgage)
- Less than standard deduction, so take standard: $29,200
- No additional tax benefit from charity

**Benefit of Bunching:**
- $7,876 tax savings from bunching
- vs. $0 savings from annual giving
- Total savings: $7,876

**Important:** If contribute $50,000 but AGI limit is $60,000:
- Deductible in 2024: $60,000
- Carryover: $0 (all used)

### Scenario 4: AMT Credit from ISOs

**Situation:**
- 2023: Exercised ISOs, triggered AMT
- AMT paid: $25,000
- Regular tax: $75,000
- Total paid: $75,000 (higher of two)

**2024:**
- Regular tax: $100,000
- AMT: $80,000
- Before credit: Pay $100,000
- AMT credit: $25,000
- After credit: $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000 (can't go below AMT)
- Credit used: $20,000
- Remaining credit: $5,000

**2025:**
- Regular tax: $120,000
- AMT: $95,000
- AMT credit: $5,000
- After credit: $120,000 - $5,000 = $115,000
- Credit used: $5,000
- Remaining credit: $0

- Check expirations
- Update records

### 2. Document Everything

**Keep Records:**
- Original forms creating carryover
- Annual forms using carryover
- Carryover tracking spreadsheet
- Tax returns (all years)

### 3. Plan Ahead

**Strategic Usage:**
- Harvest capital gains to use capital losses
- Accelerate income to use NOL
- Bunch itemized deductions to use charitable carryover
- Time asset sales to release passive losses

### 4. Don't Lose Carryovers

**Common Losses:**
- Forgetting about them (no tracking)
- Expiring unused (5-year limit on charitable)
- Not claiming on return
- Incorrect calculation

### 5. Professional Review

**Consider CPA for:**
- Complex carryovers (AMT, foreign tax, etc.)
- Large amounts (>$50,000)
- Multiple types of carryovers
- Expiring soon
