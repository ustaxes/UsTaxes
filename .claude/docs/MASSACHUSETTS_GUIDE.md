## Who Must File

### Residents

You must file a Massachusetts tax return if you were a **full-year resident** and:

1. Your **Massachusetts gross income** is greater than $8,000; **OR**
2. You want to claim a refund of withholding; **OR**
3. You owe any special taxes (such as use tax, health care penalty)

### Part-Year Residents

You must file if you:
- Moved into or out of Massachusetts during 2024; **AND**
- Met the income threshold above for the portion of the year you were a resident

### Non-Residents

- Legal separation or divorce in progress

**Note:** Your MA filing status must match your federal filing status.

## MA Tax Basics

### The 5% Flat Tax

Unlike the federal progressive tax system, Massachusetts taxes most income at a **flat 5% rate**.

**Example:**
```
MA Taxable Income: $100,000
MA Tax: $100,000 × 5% = $5,000
```

Simple! No brackets to calculate.

### Income Categories

Massachusetts divides income into three parts:

#### Part A Income (Exempt)
- Not taxable by Massachusetts
- Interest from U.S. government obligations (Treasury bonds, I-bonds)
- Certain pension income (if you qualify)
- Social Security benefits (fully exempt)

#### Part B Income (5% Rate)
- Wages, salaries, tips
- Interest (except U.S. obligations)
- Dividends (ordinary and qualified)
- Business income
- Rental income
- Pension and IRA distributions
- Unemployment compensation
- Most other income

#### Part C Income (12% Rate)
- **Short-term capital gains** (assets held 1 year or less)
- High rate discourages short-term trading

#### Part D Income (5% Rate)
- **Long-term capital gains** (assets held more than 1 year)
- Same rate as ordinary income

### Starting Point: Federal AGI

Massachusetts starts with your **Federal Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** from Form 1040, Line 11.

Then makes MA-specific adjustments:
- **Subtract:** U.S. obligation interest, certain pension income
- **Add back:** Some federal deductions not allowed by MA
- **Result:** Massachusetts Adjusted Gross Income (MA AGI)

### Exemptions

Massachusetts provides **personal exemptions** that reduce your taxable income:

**2024 Exemption Amounts:**

| Status | Exemption |
|--------|-----------|
| Single | $4,400 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $8,800 |
| Married Filing Separately | $4,400 |
| Head of Household | $6,800 |
| Each Dependent | $1,000 |

**Example (Married Filing Jointly, 2 children):**
```
Federal AGI:                    $150,000
Less: MFJ exemption:             -$8,800
Less: 2 dependents (×$1,000):    -$2,000
MA Taxable Income:              $139,200
MA Tax (5%):                     $6,960
```

### No Standard Deduction

Massachusetts does **NOT** have a standard deduction like the federal system. You get:
- Personal exemptions only
- Certain limited itemized deductions (different from federal)

## Income

### Wages and Salaries (Part B)

**What to Report:**
- All W-2 income (Box 1)
- Tips and bonuses
- Commissions
- Employer-provided benefits (if taxable)

**Massachusetts Withholding:**
- Employers must withhold 5% on MA wages
- Check W-2 Box 17 for MA tax withheld
- If you work in MA but live elsewhere, you may still have MA withholding

**Multi-State Workers:**

If you work remotely from another state for a MA employer:
- **General Rule:** Income is taxed by your residence state, not MA
- **Exception:** If your employer requires you to work in MA, that income is MA-source
- **COVID Exception:** Remote work during COVID was generally not MA-taxed if you lived elsewhere

**Example:**
```
You live in New Hampshire (no income tax)
You work remotely for a Boston company
Your home office is in NH by choice (not required by employer)

Result: No MA tax on this income (and NH has no income tax, so you pay no state tax!)
```

### Interest Income (Part B, 5%)

**Taxable Interest:**
- Bank accounts (savings, checking, CDs)
- Money market accounts
- Corporate bonds
- Peer-to-peer lending (LendingClub, Prosper)
- Tax refund interest

**Exempt Interest (Part A):**
- U.S. Treasury obligations (Treasury bills, notes, bonds, I-bonds, TIPS)
- U.S. savings bonds (Series EE, Series I)
- Federal agency bonds (if backed by full faith and credit of U.S.)

**Massachusetts Municipal Bonds:**
- Interest from MA municipal bonds is exempt from MA tax
- Interest from other states' municipal bonds is **taxable** by MA

**Example:**
```
Interest from Boston municipal bond: $1,000 → Exempt
Interest from NYC municipal bond:    $1,000 → Taxable at 5% = $50 MA tax
```

### Dividend Income (Part B, 5%)

**Types of Dividends:**
- **Ordinary dividends:** Taxable (1099-DIV Box 1a)
- **Qualified dividends:** Also taxable at 5% (MA doesn't distinguish)
- **Capital gain distributions:** Treated as long-term capital gains (Part D)

**Note:** Unlike federal tax, MA taxes qualified dividends at the same rate as ordinary dividends (both 5%). Federal taxes qualified dividends at preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%).

### Capital Gains

Massachusetts taxes capital gains differently based on holding period:

#### Short-Term Capital Gains (Part C, 12%)
- Assets held **1 year or less**
- **12% tax rate** (much higher than Part B!)
- Reported on MA Schedule D

**Example:**
```
Bought stock: March 1, 2024
Sold stock: October 1, 2024
Holding period: 7 months
Gain: $10,000

MA Tax: $10,000 × 12% = $1,200
```

#### Long-Term Capital Gains (Part D, 5%)
- Assets held **more than 1 year**
- **5% tax rate** (same as ordinary income)
- Reported on MA Schedule D

**Example:**
```
Bought stock: January 15, 2023
Sold stock: February 1, 2024
Holding period: 12+ months
Gain: $10,000

MA Tax: $10,000 × 5% = $500
```

**Tax Planning Tip:** Hold assets for more than 1 year to reduce MA tax from 12% to 5% (savings of 7 percentage points, or $700 per $10,000 gain).

#### Capital Losses

- Can offset capital gains
- Net capital loss limited to $1,000 deduction against ordinary income (MA follows federal rule)
- Unused losses carry forward to future years

### Business Income (Schedule C)

If you're self-employed or have a side business:

**Part B Income:**
- Net profit from Schedule C flows to MA Form 1
- Taxed at 5%

**Deductions:**
- MA generally follows federal Schedule C rules
- Home office deduction allowed
- Vehicle expenses allowed
- Business meals: 50% deductible (MA follows federal)

**Self-Employment Tax:**
- Not a MA tax (it's federal Social Security/Medicare)
- But you still owe it
- Remember: Total tax burden = Federal + MA + SE tax

**Example: Freelance Designer**
```
Revenue:                                $95,000
Less: Business expenses:               -$18,000
Net Profit (Schedule C):                $77,000

MA Tax: $77,000 × 5% = $3,850
(Plus you owe federal tax and SE tax on this)
```

### Rental Income (Schedule E)

**MA Rental Property:**
- Report on Schedule E
- Net rental income (rents - expenses) taxed at 5%
- Depreciation allowed (follows federal rules)

**Out-of-State Rental Property:**
- Report on Schedule E
- MA taxes this income
- But you get credit for taxes paid to other state (Schedule CMS)

**Example:**
```
MA rental property:
  Gross rents:                $24,000
  Expenses (mortgage interest,
    property tax, insurance,
    repairs, management):     -$18,500
  Depreciation:                -$4,000
  Net rental income:           $1,500

MA Tax: $1,500 × 5% = $75
```

### Retirement Income

#### Social Security Benefits
- **Fully exempt** from MA tax
- Don't report on MA return

#### Pensions and Annuities
- Generally **taxable** by MA at 5%
- Exceptions:
  - U.S. government pension (exempt if you qualify)
  - Certain contributory pensions may be partially exempt
  - Massachusetts state employee pensions have special rules

#### IRA and 401(k) Distributions
- **Taxable** at 5% when you take distributions
- Rollovers are not taxable (must be reported but not taxed)
- Roth IRA distributions: Tax-free if qualified

**Example:**
```
401(k) distribution: $30,000
Taxable amount: $30,000
MA Tax: $30,000 × 5% = $1,500
```

### Unemployment Compensation
- **Taxable** by MA at 5%
- Report on Form 1

### Gambling Winnings
- **Taxable** at 5%
- Casino, lottery, sports betting, poker
- Gambling losses can offset gambling winnings (with documentation)
- Cannot deduct more losses than winnings

---

## Deductions and Exemptions

### Personal Exemptions

**2024 Amounts:**

```
Single:                        $4,400
Married Filing Jointly:        $8,800
Married Filing Separately:     $4,400
Head of Household:             $6,800
Each Dependent:                $1,000
```

**Who Qualifies as a Dependent?**

Massachusetts follows federal rules:
- Child under age 19 (or 24 if full-time student)
- Lives with you more than half the year
- You provide more than half their support
- Has SSN or ITIN

**Or:**
- Qualifying relative (parent, sibling, etc.)
- Gross income < $4,700 (2024)
- You provide more than half their support

**Example (Family of 4):**
```
Filing Status: Married Filing Jointly
Dependents: 2 children

Personal exemption: $8,800
Dependent exemptions: 2 × $1,000 = $2,000
Total exemptions: $10,800
```

### No Standard Deduction

Massachusetts does **NOT** have a standard deduction. You only get:
1. Personal exemptions (above)
2. Limited itemized deductions (below)

### Limited Itemized Deductions

Massachusetts allows **very few** itemized deductions, and they're different from federal:

#### Medical and Dental Expenses
- Only expenses that exceed 10% of federal AGI
- Must itemize on federal Schedule A first
- Then calculate MA portion

**Example:**
```
Federal AGI: $100,000
Medical expenses: $13,000

Federal AGI × 10%: $10,000
Deductible amount: $13,000 - $10,000 = $3,000

MA Deduction: $3,000
MA Tax Savings: $3,000 × 5% = $150
```

#### Certain Massachusetts Income Taxes Paid
- Limited circumstances
- Not commonly used

### What You CANNOT Deduct

Unlike the federal return, Massachusetts does **NOT** allow deductions for:
- ❌ Home mortgage interest
- ❌ Property taxes
- ❌ State and local income taxes (SALT)
- ❌ Charitable contributions
- ❌ Student loan interest (except through Paid Family Medical Leave credit)

**This is important!** Many taxpayers expect these deductions, but MA doesn't allow them.

### Above-the-Line Deductions

Some federal above-the-line deductions that reduce your federal AGI also reduce your MA AGI:
- ✅ Traditional IRA contributions
- ✅ HSA contributions
- ✅ Self-employed health insurance
- ✅ Self-employed retirement (SEP-IRA, Solo 401(k))
- ✅ Alimony paid (for pre-2019 divorces)

These reduce your federal AGI, which is the starting point for MA.

## Credits

Massachusetts offers several tax credits:

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

**Who Qualifies:**
- You paid for care so you (and spouse, if married) could work or look for work
- Child under 13, disabled spouse, or disabled dependent
- You claimed the federal credit (Form 2441)

**MA Credit:**
- Based on your federal credit amount
- Percentage varies by income
- Generally 15% to 50% of federal credit

**Example:**
```
Federal dependent care credit: $1,000
MA income: $60,000
MA credit rate: 30% of federal credit
MA credit: $1,000 × 30% = $300

MA Tax Savings: $300
```

### Limited Income Credit (Schedule X)

**Who Qualifies:**
- MA AGI below certain thresholds
- Must have earned income
- Phaseout at higher incomes

**2024 Limits:**
- Single: MA AGI < $42,000
- Married Filing Jointly: MA AGI < $63,000
- Head of Household: MA AGI < $52,000

**Credit Amount:**
- Varies by income and family size
- Up to $420 for qualifying taxpayers
- **Refundable** (can result in refund even if you owe no tax)

### Senior Circuit Breaker Credit (Schedule CB)

**Who Qualifies:**

**Purpose:** Prevent double taxation

**How it Works:**
- Calculate tax as if you were non-resident of other state
- MA gives you credit for smaller of:
  - Tax actually paid to other state, OR
  - What MA would have taxed that income

**Example:**
```
You live in MA, work in NYC
NY wages: $50,000
NY tax paid: $3,000
MA tax on same income: $2,500

MA credit: $2,500 (the lesser amount)
You effectively pay NY rate, not both
```

- [ ] All federal schedules (A, B, C, D, E, etc.)
- [ ] Federal AGI (Line 11)

**Income Documents:**
- [ ] All W-2s (Box 16 = MA wages, Box 17 = MA withholding)
- [ ] All 1099-INT (interest)
- [ ] All 1099-DIV (dividends)

- [ ] Other states' tax returns (if claiming CMS credit)

**Prior Year:**
- [ ] 2023 MA tax return (for carryovers)

### Step 2: Determine Filing Status

**Your MA filing status MUST match your federal filing status:**

| Federal Status | MA Status |
|----------------|-----------|
| Single | Single |
| Married Filing Jointly | Married Filing Jointly |
| Married Filing Separately | Married Filing Separately |
| Head of Household | Head of Household |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse | Qualifying Surviving Spouse |

### Step 3: Calculate Massachusetts AGI

**Start with Federal AGI (Form 1040, Line 11)**

**Subtractions:**
- Interest from U.S. obligations (Treasury bonds, etc.)
- Certain pension income (if qualified)
- Massachusetts state tax refund (if you itemized last year)

**Additions:**
- Generally none for most taxpayers

**Result: Massachusetts Adjusted Gross Income (MA AGI)**

**Example:**
```
Federal AGI (Form 1040, Line 11):     $150,000
Less: U.S. Treasury interest:            -$500
Massachusetts AGI:                    $149,500
```

### Step 4: Calculate Exemptions

**Personal Exemption:**
- Single: $4,400
- MFJ: $8,800
- MFS: $4,400
- HOH: $6,800

**Dependent Exemptions:**
- Count qualifying dependents from federal return
- Each dependent: $1,000

**Total Exemptions:**
```
Personal exemption:              $8,800  (MFJ)
Dependent exemptions:
  Child 1:                       $1,000
  Child 2:                       $1,000
Total exemptions:               $10,800
```

### Step 5: Calculate Taxable Income and Tax

**Part B Income (5% rate):**
```
MA AGI:                                    $149,500
Less: Total exemptions:                    -$10,800
Part B Taxable Income:                     $138,700

Part B Tax: $138,700 × 5% =                 $6,935
```

**Part C Income (12% rate) - Short-Term Capital Gains:**
```
Short-term capital gains:                    $5,000
Part C Tax: $5,000 × 12% =                     $600
```

**Part D Income (5% rate) - Long-Term Capital Gains:**
```
Long-term capital gains:                    $20,000
Part D Tax: $20,000 × 5% =                   $1,000
```

**Total MA Tax:**
```
Part B Tax:                                  $6,935
Part C Tax:                                    $600
Part D Tax:                                  $1,000
Total Tax Before Credits:                    $8,535
```

### Step 6: Calculate Credits

**Child and Dependent Care Credit:**
```
Federal credit: $1,200
MA credit rate: 30%
MA credit: $1,200 × 30% =                      $360
```

**Other Credits:**
```
Limited Income Credit:                          $0  (income too high)
Circuit Breaker Credit:                         $0  (not age 65+)
Other state tax credit:                         $0  (no other state income)
Total Credits:                                 $360
```

**Tax After Credits:**
```
Total tax before credits:                    $8,535
Less: Total credits:                           -$360
Total Tax After Credits:                     $8,175
```

### Step 7: Calculate Payments and Refund/Amount Due

**Payments:**
```
MA tax withheld (W-2s Box 17):               $7,500
Estimated tax payments:                        $500
Total Payments:                              $8,000
```

**Refund or Amount Due:**
```
Total tax after credits:                     $8,175
Total payments:                              $8,000
Amount Owe:                                    $175
```

### Step 8: Complete Schedule HC (Health Care)

**Massachusetts requires health insurance!**

For each month of 2024, indicate:
- Had qualifying health coverage: **Y**
- Didn't have coverage but qualify for exemption: **E**
- Didn't have coverage and don't qualify for exemption: **N**

**Penalty for no coverage:**
- Up to 50% of the lowest cost health plan available to you
- Can be significant ($1,000+)

**Exemptions:**
- Financial hardship

## Common Situations

### Situation 1: W-2 Employee Only

**Profile:**
- Full-year MA resident
- One W-2 from MA employer
- No other income
- Single, no dependents

**Steps:**
1. Get Federal AGI from Form 1040
2. Verify W-2 Box 16 (MA wages) and Box 17 (MA withholding)
3. Calculate exemptions: $4,400 (single)
4. Calculate tax: (MA wages - $4,400) × 5%
5. Compare to withholding
6. Refund or owe

**Example:**
```
Federal AGI (same as MA wages): $60,000
Personal exemption:             -$4,400
MA taxable income:              $55,600
MA tax: $55,600 × 5% =           $2,780

MA withheld (W-2 Box 17):        $3,000
Refund:                            $220
```

**Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes with Claude Code

### Situation 2: Married Couple, Two W-2s

**Profile:**
- Married filing jointly
- Both work in MA
- Combined W-2 income
- Two children

**Steps:**
1. Add both W-2 wages
2. Get Federal AGI
3. Calculate exemptions: $8,800 + (2 × $1,000) = $10,800
4. Calculate tax: (Federal AGI - $10,800) × 5%
5. Add both W-2 withholdings
6. Refund or owe

**Example:**
```
Federal AGI:                    $150,000
Exemptions:                     -$10,800
MA taxable income:              $139,200
MA tax: $139,200 × 5% =           $6,960

Spouse 1 withholding:             $3,500
Spouse 2 withholding:             $2,800
Total withheld:                   $6,300
Amount owe:                         $660
```

### Situation 3: Investment Income

**Profile:**
- MA resident
- W-2 income
- Significant investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains)
- Little or no MA withholding on investment income

**Key Issue:** Investment income isn't subject to MA withholding, so you likely owe.

**Example:**
```
W-2 wages:                       $90,000
Interest income:                  $2,000
Dividend income:                 $12,000
Long-term capital gains:         $45,000
Federal AGI:                    $149,000

MA taxable income (after exemptions): $140,200

Part B tax ($104,200 × 5%):       $5,210
Part D tax ($45,000 × 5%):        $2,250
Total MA tax:                     $7,460

W-2 withholding:                  $4,500
Amount owe:                       $2,960
```

**Planning:** Make estimated payments to avoid underpayment penalty!

### Situation 4: Self-Employed

**Profile:**
- Self-employed consultant
- No W-2
- Schedule C business income
- Home office, business expenses

**Steps:**
1. Calculate net profit on federal Schedule C
2. Net profit flows to federal Form 1040
3. Federal AGI includes Schedule C profit
4. Calculate MA tax on profit (5%)
5. Make sure you made estimated payments!

**Example:**
```
Schedule C revenue:              $120,000
Schedule C expenses:             -$35,000
Net profit:                       $85,000

Federal AGI (includes SE profit): $85,000
Less: Personal exemption:         -$4,400
MA taxable income:                $80,600
MA tax: $80,600 × 5% =             $4,030

Estimated payments made:           $3,200
Amount owe:                          $830
```

**Don't forget:** You also owe self-employment tax (federal) of ~$12,000!

### Situation 5: Remote Worker in NH

**Profile:**
- Lives in New Hampshire
- Works remotely for MA company
- Home office by choice (not employer requirement)
- No MA withholding (or seeking refund)

**Tax Treatment:**
- **No MA tax owed** (NH is your tax home)
- **NH has no income tax** (you pay no state income tax!)
- If employer withheld MA tax incorrectly, file Form 1-NR/PY to get refund

**Note:** This changed during COVID. Many remote workers discovered they owed no MA tax.

### Situation 6: Part-Year Resident

**Profile:**
- Moved from California to Massachusetts in July
- CA wages: Jan-June ($40,000)
- MA wages: July-Dec ($45,000)

**Steps:**
1. File Form 1-NR/PY (part-year resident)
2. Report all income to both states
3. Allocate income by state
4. MA only taxes MA-source income
5. Credit for taxes paid to CA on CA income

**Example:**
```
Total income:                     $85,000
MA-source income:                 $45,000
CA-source income:                 $40,000

MA taxes only the $45,000 earned while MA resident
File MA Form 1-NR/PY
File CA part-year return as well
```

### Situation 7: Rental Property Owner

**Profile:**
- Owns rental property in Boston
- Collects rent, pays expenses
- Schedule E income

**Steps:**
1. Calculate net rental income on federal Schedule E
2. Flows to federal Form 1040
3. MA taxes net rental income at 5%

**Example:**
```
Gross rents:                      $30,000
Expenses:
  Mortgage interest:               $8,000
  Property tax:                    $6,000
  Insurance:                       $1,500
  Repairs:                         $2,000
  Management:                      $3,000
  Depreciation:                    $5,000
Total expenses:                   $25,500

Net rental income:                 $4,500

MA tax: $4,500 × 5% =                $225
```

### Situation 8: Retired with Pension

**Profile:**
- Age 68
- Social Security: $30,000/year
- Pension: $45,000/year
- Home owner (property tax $7,500)

**Steps:**
1. Social Security is exempt (don't report)
2. Pension is taxable
3. May qualify for Circuit Breaker credit

**Example:**
```
Social Security:                  $30,000  (exempt, not taxed)
Pension income:                   $45,000  (taxable)
Federal AGI:                      $45,000

MA AGI:                           $45,000
Less: Personal exemption (single): -$4,400
MA taxable income:                $40,600
MA tax: $40,600 × 5% =             $2,030

Pension withholding:               $2,250
Potential refund:                    $220

Plus: Circuit Breaker credit:        $850  (based on property tax/income ratio)
Total refund:                      $1,070
```

### Situation 9: College Student

**Profile:**
- Age 21, full-time student
- Parents claim as dependent
- Summer job in MA: $8,000
- No other income

**Filing Requirement:**
- Must file if MA income ≥ $8,000
- Even though parents claim dependency exemption

**Tax:**
```
W-2 income:                        $8,000
Less: Personal exemption:         -$4,400
MA taxable income:                 $3,600
MA tax: $3,600 × 5% =                $180

W-2 withholding:                     $400
Refund:                              $220
```

**Note:** Parents still claim the $1,000 dependent exemption on their return.

### Situation 10: Day Trader

**Profile:**
- Active stock trader
- Many short-term trades (holding < 1 year)
- Significant short-term capital gains

**Issue:** Short-term gains taxed at 12% (Part C)!

**Example:**
```
W-2 income:                       $75,000
Short-term capital gains:         $50,000
Long-term capital gains:          $20,000
Federal AGI:                     $145,000

MA Calculation:
Part B income ($75,000 - $4,400): $70,600 × 5% = $3,530
Part C income (short-term):       $50,000 × 12% = $6,000
Part D income (long-term):        $20,000 × 5% = $1,000
Total MA tax:                     $10,530

W-2 withholding only:              $3,750
Amount owe:                        $6,780
```

**Major penalty if you didn't make estimated payments!**

**Tax Planning:** Consider holding stocks > 1 year to reduce MA tax from 12% to 5%.

## MA-Specific Issues

### Health Care Individual Mandate

**Massachusetts requires health insurance!**

Unlike federal (which eliminated the penalty in 2019), Massachusetts still has an individual mandate.

**Requirements:**
- Must have "minimum creditable coverage" for all 12 months
- Or qualify for exemption

**Schedule HC:**
- Must file with every MA return
- Report coverage for each month
- Indicate exemptions

**Penalty for No Coverage:**
- 50% of the lowest cost ConnectorCare plan available to you
- Can be $100/month or more
- Assessed per adult (not per family)

**Example:**
```
Lowest cost plan available: $300/month
You had no coverage for 6 months
Penalty: $300 × 50% × 6 months = $900
```

**Exemptions:**
- Financial hardship (affordable plan > 5% of income)
- Religious beliefs
- Coverage gap ≤ 3 consecutive months
- Incarcerated
- Certain visa holders

**How to Comply:**
- Employer coverage
- MassHealth (Medicaid)
- Medicare
- Health Connector plans
- Federal exchange plans (if creditable)
- Private insurance

### Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML)

**Massachusetts PFML:**
- Provides paid leave for family/medical reasons
- Funded by payroll tax

**Who Pays:**
- Employees: ~0.29% of wages (up to Social Security wage base)
- Appears on W-2 Box 14 as "MAPFML"

**Tax Treatment:**
- PFML contribution is **NOT deductible**
- Appears on W-2 but doesn't reduce taxable wages
- Self-employed can opt in and get credit

**Example W-2:**
```
Box 1 (Wages): $90,000
Box 14: MAPFML $261  (this is what you paid)
```

This $261 doesn't affect your MA tax. It's already included in wages.

### Estate Tax

**Massachusetts has an estate tax** (separate from income tax):

**Threshold:** $2 million (2024)

If your estate exceeds $2 million at death:
- Estate tax applies
- Starts at 0.8%, up to 16%
- Tax applies to entire estate, not just amount over $2 million

**Example:**
```
Estate value: $2.5 million
Estate is $500K over threshold
But tax is on full $2.5M, not just the $500K
```

**Planning:** Important for high net worth MA residents. Consider:
- Gifting during life
- Trusts
- Moving to state with no estate tax (NH, FL)

### Property Tax

**Not part of income tax, but important:**

Massachusetts has high property taxes (avg 1.1% of home value).

**Note:** Property tax is **NOT deductible** on MA income tax return.

But:
- Circuit Breaker credit (seniors)
- Based on property tax relative to income
- Can provide refund

### Sales and Use Tax

**6.25% sales tax** on most goods.

**Use Tax:**
- You owe use tax on out-of-state purchases if you didn't pay MA sales tax
- Common: Online purchases from out-of-state sellers
- Report on Form 1, separate line

**Example:**
```
Bought $5,000 of furniture from NH (no sales tax)
Brought it back to MA home
Owe MA use tax: $5,000 × 6.25% = $312.50
```

Most people don't report this, but technically required.

### Commuter Deduction (Eliminated)

**Historical Note:**
- MA used to allow deduction for commuter expenses
- **Eliminated in 2019**
- No longer available

### Massachusetts vs. Federal Differences

| Item | Federal | Massachusetts |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Social Security | Taxable (up to 85%) | **Exempt** |
| Municipal bond interest | Exempt (if in-state) | MA bonds exempt, others **taxable** |
| Qualified dividends | 0-20% rate | **5% rate** (no preference) |
| Long-term capital gains | 0-20% rate | **5% rate** |
| Short-term capital gains | Ordinary rates | **12% rate** |
| Mortgage interest | Deductible (if itemize) | **Not deductible** |
| Property tax | Deductible (up to $10K) | **Not deductible** |
| Charitable gifts | Deductible (if itemize) | **Not deductible** |
| Student loan interest | Up to $2,500 deduction | **Not deductible** |

Voters approved "millionaire's tax" (4% surtax on income > $1M) starting in 2023, but that's a separate additional tax.

---

## Appendix B: Exemption History

Personal exemptions have increased to keep pace with inflation:

| Year | Single | MFJ | HOH | Dependent |

## Appendix D: Multi-State Scenarios

### Living in NH, Working in MA

**The Telecommuter Rule:**

**Rule:** If you live in NH and work remotely for a MA company:
- If remote by choice → No MA tax
- If remote by employer requirement → MA tax

**COVID Exception:**
- Remote work during COVID (2020-2021) was generally not MA-taxed if you lived in NH
- MA can't tax you just because employer is in MA

**Example:**
```
You: Live in Portsmouth, NH
Employer: Boston, MA company
Work: 100% remote from NH home office

Result: No MA tax (and NH has no income tax!)
You pay zero state income tax.
```

**But:** If you go into the MA office, those days are MA-taxed.

### Living in MA, Working in NH

**Simple:**
- NH has no income tax
- MA taxes all your income (you're a MA resident)
- No credit needed (no NH tax paid)

**Example:**
```
You: Live in Boston, MA
Work: Portsmouth, NH

MA taxes all income at 5%
NH has no income tax
```

### Living in MA, Working in NY

**Both states want to tax you!**

**Solution:** Credit for taxes paid to other states (Schedule CMS)

**Example:**
```
You: Live in Cambridge, MA
Work: NYC office

Income: $100,000

NY taxes you: ~$6,000 (NY nonresident rate)
MA taxes you: $5,000 (5% rate)

MA gives you credit for NY tax paid
You effectively pay NY rate ($6,000)
MA credit: $5,000
Additional to MA: $0
```

Result: You pay NY rate, not both.

### Living in RI, Working in MA

**Rhode Island has income tax (~5.99%)**

**If you commute to MA for work:**
- MA withholds tax on your MA wages
- RI taxes all your income (you're a RI resident)
- RI gives you credit for MA tax paid

**Example:**
```
You: Live in Providence, RI
Work: Boston, MA

MA wages: $80,000
MA tax withheld: $4,000

RI taxes the $80,000 too
RI tax: ~$4,800
RI credit for MA tax: -$4,000
Additional to RI: $800
```

File both MA non-resident return and RI resident return.
