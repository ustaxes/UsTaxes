    - Amounts paid in consideration for services (for example, distributions from a foreign retirement plan that 
    are paid in the form of an annuity and include investment income that was earned by the retirement plan).

    How your annuities are reported to you. Net investment income from annuities is reported to a recipient on 
    Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance 
    Contracts, etc. However, the amount reported on Form 1099-R may also include annuity payments from 
    retirement plans that are exempt from NIIT. Amounts subject to NIIT should be identified with code "D" in box 7. 
    If code "D" is shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R, include on Form 8960, line 3, the taxable amount reported 
    on Form 1099-R, box 2a. However, if the payor checks box 2b indicating the taxable amount can’t be determined, 
    you may need to calculate the taxable portion of your distribution. See Pub. 939, General Rule for Pensions 
    and Annuities, and Pub. 575, Pension and Annuity Income, for details.
