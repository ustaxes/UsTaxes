## Note on using this project

This project is built by a growing community. If you notice an error in the outputted PDF or any other error, please submit an issue on the Github issues tab. We appreciate your feedback!

## User Data

The project is available strictly via client side. Data is persisted to the site's localstorage so _no personal information ever leaves the user's computer._ For those who want extra security, the codebase can also be built as a [desktop application](#desktop-application).

## Contributing

## Get Started

This application can be run as either a web application or a [standalone desktop application](#user-content-desktop-application)

### Web application

This project runs on Node 20. To ensure you're on the proper version, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

With `nvm` installed, you may select a version 20 node using:

```sh
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

To run,

```sh
npm ci          # install package dependencies
npm run start   # run app
```

Note: To avoid having to set your node versions, we suggest using a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net). With the following configuration file as `.envrc` in project root:

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
#. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # Optional, nvm bash completion

nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

your environment will be set up every time you enter the project directory.

#### Docker

If preferred, a Docker alternative is available:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

To stop and remove running containers, run `docker-compose down`.

### Desktop application

The desktop application is built with [Tauri][tauri-root]. In addition to the above steps, please [follow this reference for setting up your environment for Tauri][tauri-setup].

Once your environment is set up for Tauri, run, `npm run desktop`. To avoid a browser window being spawned in addition to the desktop window, just set the BROWSER environment variable as in: `BROWSER=none npm run desktop`.

To build executables, run `npm run desktop-release`.
